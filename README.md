I recently wrapped up a comprehensive Data Analysis project comparing India's food delivery giants. Beyond the colorful UI, this project was about understanding the "how" and "why" behind the numbers.

KPI Tracking: Monitoring $253K in total sales and $45K in profit across platforms.
Geographic Insights: Chennai and Bangalore emerging as top-performing hubs.
User Behavior: Visualizing payment trends where Debit Cards and Cash still lead the race.
Platform Rivalry: A neck-and-neck battle with Zomato holding a slight edge at 50.4% market share.
